This full-stack system models 50+ real-world locations, using A for routing* and a priority queue for emergency vehicles. A Flask backend handles route computation, while a responsive front end displays dynamic routes on a canvas-based map. Features include real-time path updates, emergency handling, and a sleek UI.
